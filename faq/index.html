                <h2 id="q2">Authentication</h2>

                <p>Gisto authenticates to GitHub by using basic authentication over SSL and retrieving an oAuth2 token
                    Thus the need for your GitHub user and password.</p>

                <p>Gisto only saves the oAuth2 token received after authenticating and nothing else.
                    If you would rather to supply your own access token without providing Gisto your login details you
                    may manually create an access token from the account settings at GitHub and login using the
                    generated token.</p>

                <p>This token will be saved permanently until you log out.</p>

                <h2 id="q3">Do you use backend server?</h2>

                <p>Gisto is using GitHub gist API and communicates directly with Github, no 3rd party server or database
                    involved in gist management. </p>

                <p>However we do use a server for notifications and sharing service, the only data is stored is username
                    and gist ID and this is to allow gisto to notify user if there are shares waiting for him/her to
                    accept.
                </p>

                <p>The server code is in the repository should you wish to run an alternative server.</p>

                <h2 id="q4">Who can see my gists?</h2>

                <p>As per GitHub Guidelines gists are not private and are available to the public.</p>

                <p>The difference between secret and public gists is that public gists are listed on GitHub website for
                    public viewing and searching while secret gists are not</p>


                <h2 id="q5">Do you plan to support / add support for [<i>future-name-here</i>]?</h2>
