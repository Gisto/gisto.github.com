                <h3>GitHub Integration</h3>

                <p>
                    Gisto works using GitHub gists infrastructure, any change you make is automatically updated at
                    GitHub.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you don't have access to your computer you can browse normally at GitHub to view everything
                    you've created.
                </p>

                <h3>Enterprise mode</h3>

                <p>Enterprise mode in Gisto allows connecting to your GitHub enterprise (on-premise) instead of public

                <p>Gisto works the same as it did until now except for a small subset of features that do not make sense
                    on GitHub Enterprise.</p>
