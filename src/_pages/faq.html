                <h2 id="q1">What is Gisto?</h2>

                <p>Gisto is a code snippet manager that runs on GitHub Gists and adds additional features
                    such as searching, tagging and sharing gists while including a rich code editor.
                </p>
                <p>Gisto is cross platform and is in constant sync with GitHub so you can view and edit
                    your Gists via both Gisto and GitHub.
                </p>


                <h2 id="q2">Authentication</h2>

                <p>Gisto authenticates to GitHub by using basic authentication over SSL and retrieving an oAuth2 token
                    thus the need for your GitHub user and password.</p>

                <p>Gisto only saves the oAuth2 token received after authenticating and nothing else.
                    If you would rather to supply your own access token without providing Gisto your login details you
                    may manually create an access token from the account settings at GitHub and login using the
                    generated token.</p>

                <p>This token will be saved permanently until you log out.</p>

                <h2 id="q3">Do you use backend server?</h2>

                <p>Gisto is using GitHub gist API and communicates directly with Github, no 3rd party server or database
                    involved in gist management. </p>

                <p>However we do use a backend server for "notifications and sharing service", the only data stored is username
                    and gist ID and this is to allow Gisto to notify user if there are Gists shared with him.
                </p>

                <p>You also have the option of running your own notification server so you can be sure your data is secure.</p>

                <h2 id="q4">Who can see my Gists?</h2>

                <p>As per GitHub Guidelines Gists are not private and are available to the public.</p>

                <p>The difference between secret and public Gists is that public Gists are listed on GitHub website for
                    public viewing and searching while secret Gists are not</p>
